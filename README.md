- neural_01
  Making "hello, world!" in neural network field. 
  Recognize hand written digits 0-9 via neural network with MNIST base.
  
  neural_01/main.py
  - make skeleton of neural network
  - Load train and test data from files (images of digits [0-9]
  - print 1 train & 1 test image to check that net "understands" them

  neural_01/main_01.py
  - train the net with small (100 images) set of data
  - query the net with 1 image of test set (10 images) of data
